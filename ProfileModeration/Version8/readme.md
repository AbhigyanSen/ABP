# Face Occlusion Detection - Version 8
Dummy version to check and fix issues. Fixed issue of the "Images" folder not being deleted.
Reason for the same is that Images folder is present outside of API and the program had relative path.
Solution was to shift the "Images" folder inside of Version8.

## Overview
> Version 7 of the Face Occlusion Detection project builds upon the capabilities introduced in Version 6, focusing on improving accuracy and addressing specific scenarios related to face occlusion analysis. This version includes updates to path configurations, error handling, and model confidence thresholds to enhance the overall functionality and reliability of the system.

## Model Configuration Update

### Version 7:
- Enhanced detection capabilities for face occlusion using various models.
- Robust error handling for image processing and model inference.
- Updated paths for Image storage and Model Weights.
