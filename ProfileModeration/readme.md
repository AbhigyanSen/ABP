# Face Occlusion Detection
#####  This project focuses on determining the **Acceptance** or **Rejection** of images based on face occlusion analysis. The system evaluates images for the presence and clarity of facial features to ensure reliable identification.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/AbhigyanSen/ABP/tree/main/Version5)

The code leverages several deep learning models and techniques:
+ **Face Detection and Cropping:**
Utilizes InsightFace and Face recognition for accurate face detection and cropping, isolating facial regions from images.
+ **Facial Landmark Detection:** 
Implements MediaPipe alongside Face Recognition to detect facial landmarks, enabling assessment of the completeness of facial features.
+ **Text and Image Analysis:** 
Integrates CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) for analyzing images based on textual descriptions, identifying potential occlusions such as hats or masks or even sunglasses.
+ **NSFW Content Detection:**
FalconAi NSFW Detection detects NSFW content in images to ensure filtering of obscence content.
+ **Animated/Cartoon Image Detection:**
Utilizes CLIP to identify animated or cartoon images, expanding the types of content analyzed.
+ **Phone Number Detection:**
Implements Paddle-OCR for extracting and verifying the presence of phone numbers in images.
+ **Object Detection:** 
Employs YOLO (You Only Look Once) for detecting objects like sunglasses, eyeglasses, headwear, etc., which may occlude facial features.

The project implements a comprehensive approach combining multiple modalities to make a final decision regarding the acceptance of images. It aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of face recognition systems by addressing common challenges posed by occlusions.

## Features

- Detects faces in images using InsightFace for precise localization.
- Applies facial landmark detection with MediaPipe to ensure facial feature completeness.
- Detects NSFW content in images using FalconAiâ€™s NSFW Image Detection to ensure filtration of obscene content.
- Utilizes CLIP to identify animated or cartoon images, expanding the types of content analyzed.
- Implements POCR for extracting and verifying the presence of phone numbers in images.
- Utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection to identify potential occlusions like sunglasses, hats, and masks.
- Integrates CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) for analyzing images based on textual descriptions to further assess occlusion presence.
- Provides a comprehensive decision-making process for image acceptance based on combined results from multiple detection and analysis techniques.
- Supports real-time processing of image data, making it suitable for applications requiring immediate feedback on image quality and content.
